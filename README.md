This repository holds an interactive page showcasing the Verbalucce Project originally developed by Intel & iterated on by researchers at the University of Washington. This utility is a chrome extension that modifies the Gmail compose window so people are more aware of their communication with other people - particularly the way they synchronize language and emotion.

Notes:

A few files are specifically left out of the repo, in particular:
* LIWC2007_English100131.dic holds a mapping of words to language & emotional context. This dictionary is originally based on the 2007 edition of the LIWC project classification of words which is under copyright.
* The ext folder contains libraries of javascript and css from other developers, in particular Bootstrap.
